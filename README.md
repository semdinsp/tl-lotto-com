# These are the public websites for estorm customers
They use nesta cms as a basic platform and haml for markdown.
There is some interesting haml code if you take a look through the pages to manage menus etc.  In particular this nesta site supports translations using the iI8n gem.

There is a travis job running to validate the sites on every commit.
